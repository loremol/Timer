# Timer
Timer is a C++ application realized with [wxWidgets](https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets).

It can run multiple timers at the same time and show you when each one of them will stop.
You can customize the format of the timers' start and end dates and that of the remaining time.
The timers are saved to disk when you close the application so that they can resume and have the same end date when you open Timer again.
